 Using [this SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API), create an Angular application that shows a list of SpaceX launches in a sortable (by launch order) grid. The user should be able to page through the results. The columns of the grid should be Flight Number, Launch Year, Rocket Name, and Details. For a given launch, the user should be able to click on the row to be given the option to view and navigate to populated media links (webcast, youtube, etc) provided in the API response.
